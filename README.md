cs50_final_project
==================

This was my final project for Harvard CS50.

I created a train routing app optimized for a mobile phone. I wrote all of the code from scratch and also setup and installed everything necassary for the web server. 

Implementation details:

Server: Amazon EC2 running Amazon Linux

Database: MongoDB - with custom written Python script to load all of the data from GTFS feed

Backend/Routing Algorithm - PHP - custom written routing algorithm to get the possible routes. Also implemented a custom double-linked-list to track each route.

Front End - PHP with jQuery mobile
